## About Me

Iâ€™m a Software Engineering Degree Apprentice with a strong background in Computer Science and Maths.  
I love solving problems, developing creative solutions, and building projects that push me to learn more.  

Outside of coding, Iâ€™m a drummer, vinyl collector, and all-round sci-fi/fantasy nerd.
