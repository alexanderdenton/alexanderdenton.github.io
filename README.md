## About Me

I’m a Software Engineering Degree Apprentice with a strong background in Computer Science and Maths.  
I love solving problems, developing creative solutions, and building projects that push me to learn more.  

Outside of coding, I’m a drummer, vinyl collector, and all-round sci-fi/fantasy nerd.
